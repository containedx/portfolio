    description: "Project created for Engineer's Thesis. It presents simulation of Boids Algorithm. First invented by Craig Reynolds, it simulates flock behaviour(such as birds, sheep, fish flock) using  three simple rules: separation, alignment, and cohesion. In project I included a target that is followed by intelligent flock. To show practical use of this algorithm I created game that uses boids algorithm for enemies. This algorithm is widely used in movies and games, for realistic crowd behaviour, animal herd behaviour, swarm robotics.",
